# Dotfiles
These are my dotfiles. 

## Vim
My setup is created for Neovim with Spacevim. First, install neovim (for example, you can use `sudo pacman -S neovim` on Arch). Then install spacevim from it's official website. Before proceeding to the next step, you must run `nvim` at least once to download relevant plugins.
Now, copy over all the files in the vim/.SpaceVim and vim/.SpaceVim.d to the respective folders in your home folder ($HOME). Some of them may overwrite existing ones - that's alright.
